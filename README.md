# dance-score-sheets
This is a website that will calculate rankings of dancers given judges scores. Project uses a JSON database, and would ideally be deployed to FireBase. The front end is written in Javascript using the React Framework.

## The ETL will be written in Python, and piped to Firebase.

1. User Firebase.
2. Parisi will write algorithm for scoring (Required reading).
3. Nguyen will figure out which testing framework to use (Frontend & database?).
4. Penkar will figure out the larger architecture of the application.
  1. Decide on Authentication
  2. Decide on view? Landing with all dances scored? Personal page? Rules? Setup competition?
  3. Figure out a hierarchy for the above.
  4. Figure out what UI library we want to use. [MATERIAL-UI]
5. FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEE GITHUB Notifications.
6. Scraped material : getting it into FireBase.
7. Parisi / Nguyen will race to see who can setup an NPM project.
